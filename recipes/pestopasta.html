        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Penne pasta</li>
            <li>Jarred pesto</li>
            <li>Chicken breast</li>
            <li>Broccoli</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Jalapenos</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>Parmesan</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Start your pasta.</strong> Fill a large stockpot with water and season generously with salt. Bring to a boil over medium high heat. Cook your penne according to package instructions.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook your chicken.</strong> Add 2 tbsp of olive oil to a large pan and cook over medium high heat. Add diced jalapenos and let the oil infuse for a 1 to 2 minutes. Then, add your cubed chicken breast, stirring occasionally until all sides are white and no pink is visible.</li>
            <li><strong>Add the brocolli.</strong> Chop 2 heads of brocolli into bite sized pieces and add to the pan to sautee along with 3 cloves of garlic, minced. Cover, stirring every few minutes, until brocolli is cooked but still firm, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Mix the pasta.</strong> When the pasta is done, drain and add to the chicken and brocolli mixture. Toss the ingredients together, then add the full jar of pesto and stir to combine. Serve with a side salad.</li>
        </ol>
